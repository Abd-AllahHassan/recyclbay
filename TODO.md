# TODO: Fix Mobile Header Left Shift on Home Page

## Tasks
- [ ] Reduce top padding in Hero.jsx from pt-32 lg:pt-20 to pt-20 for consistent header alignment on mobile
- [ ] Add explicit w-full to Hero section className
- [ ] Add w-full to outer div in HomePage.jsx for width consistency
- [ ] Test on mobile: Launch browser to http://localhost:5173/, resize to mobile view, verify header no left shift, compare with /products
- [ ] If persists, inspect and edit src/index.css for global RTL/mobile rules (e.g., body margin/padding)
- [ ] Mark this section as completed once verified
